# Six Degrees of Foxes

JP Morgan & Chase 2017 Code for Good hackathon in Jersey City

## Client Information
[SixDegress.org] (https://www.sixdegrees.org/) is a charity led by actor, musician, and philanthropist Kevin Bacon. The non-profit organization helps local and grassroots charities in the United States.

## Project Proposal
Stacy Bradford, executive director of [SixDegress.org] (https://www.sixdegrees.org/), is currently the only person maintaining the website and administering their projects. Their current website only provides information about the company and events, a contact form, and a link to PayPal for their users to donate. A lot of the work to setup events are still done manually by Stacy. For this project, she would like us to create a new website for her that will allow her and their users to track their contributions. She also would like to gamify the process by having users be able to earn rewards from inviting other people to donate.

## Our Solution
We wanted to provide Stacy with a solution that would provide the features that she requested, while also making it easy for her to use. Our web application allows users to login and donate or volunteer for non-profit organizations that [SixDegress.org] (https://www.sixdegrees.org/) is currently working with. With each action, the user would be promted to invite three more people to help the cause. Their progress will be tracked and will be rewarded when they have made a certain amount of impact. For Stacy, we provided an admin dashboard that shows her visual data reports of each event and individual's progress and one that gives her the ability to create and manage different events.
